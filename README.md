C++ Web Development Framework for Linux
v0.1

The main goal of this project is to create a way of developing complex and highly scalable web applications (and not only) in C++.

Features:
- Sendfile support. Transfers files from the filesystem with no userspace copying
- Single threaded architecture (soon multi-process)
- High performance (can run on a Raspberry Pi with no problem)
- Used as a library. One only has to provide the route/method/callback combinations
- Can be used as a backend for JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS

Long term goals:
- Asynchronous responding
- SSL support
- MVC support
